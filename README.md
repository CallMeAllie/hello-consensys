First foray into Git for the Consensys Developer course. Here we go!

Hi ConsenSys Academy folk,

Allison here. By day, I fight inefficient uses of energy and water on the island of Guam, and by night I obsess over blockchain. Sometimes I transition by drinking a beer on the beack with my dog, Winnie. 

My first introduction to programming came during college, around 2003. I had to take a C++ course and loved it. But, switching majors would have been near impossible at that point, and my identical twin sister was already a CS major, so, well, I built robots and dune buggies from a mechanical perspective and figured that opportunities to program would materialize.

Fast forward to recent times. Over the last few years, I've done independent research and education into programming, following tutorials here and there, most recently cryptozombies.io, and courses like MITx 6.00.1x on edX. Simultaneously, I was introduced to BTC by reading articles on the deep web and found the emerging technology fascinating. Today, my interests lie in learning more about applications for decentralized networks and how they can play a part in providing solutions to our world's most pressing issues. My specialty is energy, but I'd like to explore the area between blockchain enthusiasts and any subject matter experts who have never heard of this technology, let alone considered the applications to their passions. Broad, I know, but I believe I want to work in bridging the gap between blockchain big thinkers and all the academics, activists, students, grandmas, consultants, politicians, and more working in spaces that need blockchain to make a paradigm shift and don't know it. 

Thing is, I haven't delved enough into blockchain to know where I fit. This course is a directed effort on my part to gain working knowledge of a technology to better understand it's potential applications. I can't think of a better guide than ConsenSys.

Being on a small tropical island can feel isolating when it comes to exploring big bold frontiers liek blockchain. When you find kindred spirits, you tend to cluster. To that end, my friend and fellow enthisuast Cyrus Luhr will be pursuing this course with me, so that we can support each other through the work necessary to understand development on the Ethereum blockchain and fill in gaps in our self-taught programming backgrounds.

I was also been lucky enough to meet some folks at Camp DECENTRAL at Burning Man 2017 and attend a number of excellent talks. At the end of this course, I'll head back to the Playa and hope to be able to better connect over blockchain and how it can further some of the ideals shared during the week. This year, if I meet Thessy again, I'll actually stay in touch ;)

Thanks for reading, and I am most excited to learn from you all.


Cheers, 

Allison
